# 100DaysOfRust
Learn Rust and Swift in parallel. Comparing the language features.

Day 1: [Variables and Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html)
1. let defines immutable variables by default
2. let x = 1; let x = "  "; will create new variable with same name. This is called variable shadowing.

Day 2: [Control FLow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html)
1. break x + 1; break the loop and return a value
2. expression block shall not append ";" to the last line.
